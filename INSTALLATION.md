# Installation Guide

To install the launcher, follow these instructions:
1. Grab the [latest release from here](https://github.com/WSU-4110/PhysicalMediaGameLauncher/releases) for your operating system (if you're using Windows and are unsure of whether to get `StandaloneWindows` or `StandaloneWindows-64`, then pick `StandaloneWindows`)
2. Extract the zip somewhere on your computer
3. If you're on Windows/Linux, then run `Standalone<Platform>`. If you're on Mac, then drag the `StandaloneOSX.app` to your App folder and run it from there
4. Enjoy!

# Extra
If you want the launcher to automatically start up whenever you boot up your computer, then you can do the following:

Windows: Open up `Task Scheduler` and create a new basic task that runs on startup. Make it launch the launcher executable.
Linux: If you're using Linux, you most likely have your own solution for this. If not though, then you can follow [this guide](https://askubuntu.com/a/48327)!
Mac: Follow along [this video](https://youtu.be/H1GSUuiap-Q?t=85) and add the launcher to the startup apps list!
